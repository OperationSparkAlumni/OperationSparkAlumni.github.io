    Letter from a code editor
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dear readers,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in the Operation Spark Alumni Newsletter! In this newsletter we aim to share resources
      that we think are useful, interesting, or just awesome. This month’s content comes from the alumni board, but if
      you read to the end we have a form for alum suggestions! We want to hear what you think is cool and exciting so we
      can share it with the rest of our community.

    <h2>Learning/Practice Resource</h2>
    <h3>
      Learning by implementing
    </h3>
    <p>
      There can, at times, be a sense that the greatest software engineers create their own stuff and other people join
      in and work on it. However, one of the best ways to grow as an engineer is by reimplementing things that have
      already been done, and then comparing your solution to theirs. Here is a quote from The Coding Career Handbook
      that explains this really well:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your decision-making is a scarce resource. You start every day with a full tank, and as you make decisions
      through the day you gradually run low. We all know how good our late-late night decisions are. Making a new app
      involves a thousand micro decisions - from what the app does, to how it should look, and everything in between.
      Decide now: Do you want to practice making technical decisions or product decisions?
      Ok so you’re coding. You know what involves making zero product decisions? Cloning things. Resist the urge to make
      your special snowflake (for now). Oh but then who would use yet another Hacker News clone? I’ve got news for you:
      No one was gonna use your thing anyway. You’re practicing coding, not making a startup. Remember?
      Make the clone on your own, then check the original’s source. Now you have TWO examples of how to implement
      something, so you even get to practice something people only do after years of experience: understanding the
      tradeoffs of technical choices!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Stop feeling stuck by agonizing over what to do for your next project and clone some of these:
      <ul>
        <li>Reddit</li>
        <li>Hacker News</li>
        <li>Spotify</li>
        <li>Freecodecamp.com has some good projects in a lot of different areas</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Or follow along with some of these:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://nandgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

      This month’s newsletter was curated by Alexa Welch, Alon Robinson, Eddie Smith Jr, Emily Yu, and Olivia Sabo-Rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it’s a fascinating technology you want to spread awareness of, some rad way people are making art in CSS,
      success stories of members of underserved communities, or something awesome that you’re personally doing (we know
      you miss writing those Medium posts, right? ...right?), we all want to know so that we can share in this alumni
      community together and lift ourselves and each other higher than ever.
