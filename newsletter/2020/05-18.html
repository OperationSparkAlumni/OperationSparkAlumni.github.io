      Letter from a code editor
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dear readers,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in the Operation Spark Alumni Newsletter! In this newsletter we aim to share resources
      that we think are useful, interesting, or just awesome. This month’s content comes from the alumni board, but if
      you read to the end we have a form for alum suggestions! We want to hear what you think is cool and exciting so we
      can share it with the rest of our community.

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://discord.com/invite/typescript" target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer”>
        TypeScript Discord
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      A great way to get into a new language or framework is to dive into a community surrounding your subject of
      interest. This month we have the TypeScript Discord, for our JS fans who want to keep things organized with types
      (and other cool features). With over 5000 members, and a fifth of them currently online as I’m typing this, you’re
      bound to see some great conversations around this JavaScript superset.
    </p>

    <h2>Podcast</h2>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://www.designcuts.com/learning-hub/podcasts/episode-134-working-smarter-in-your-creative-business/"
        target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer”>
        Working Smarter in Your Creative Business
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Though this podcast is not about development, it’s about design, the idea of working smarter can translate into
      any field of work. I really loved listening to the hosts speak about improving yourself, or your work, by just 1%
      each day. It’s such an attainable goal, and though it feels small in the moment it leads to much larger gains.

    <p>
      Although React Hooks have been out for a while now, I still feel like the pool of legitimate sources of info on it
      is a bit lacking; maybe I’m just bad at Googling, but it’s often felt like there are just 10 Medium articles that
      all say the same thing. And then I came across this blog entry! It’s a really great resource from one of the React
      Core team members, and I was surprised that I hadn’t seen it before, so now I’m sharing it with you, in all of its
      50-minute-read-time glory.

    <h2>Inspirational Software Project</h2>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/tetraly/zelda-randomizer" target="_blank" rel=”noopener noreferrer”>
        Zelda Video Game Randomizer
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This is a cohesive and fairly lightweight open-source Python program that does the arcane magic of taking the tiny
      ROM of The Legend of Zelda for the NES/Famicom, shuffling things around such that the game is still completable
      with a variety of configurations, and producing a new ROM of a unique The Legend of Zelda experience. Many video
      game randomizers are closed-source, so this is a fun and uncommon opportunity to dig into the kind of thing that
      makes many people’s passion projects!

    <p>
      A lot of people are without work right now, and part of the daunting process of finding a new job is interviewing.
      Thankfully Hacker Rank has put together a bunch of interview prompts you may be asked to implement! When you’re
      done you can check out the other sections of Hacker Rank to practice your favorite coding languages, and maybe
      even get some job offers.

    <h2>Feedback & Suggestion Forms</h2>
    <p>
      This month’s newsletter was curated by Alexa Welch, Daniel Weill, Emily Yu, and Olivia Sabo-Rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want this newsletter to be for the whole alumni network, so we want to hear what you think is cool and exciting
      so we can share it with others. It doesn’t have to be educational or even immediately programming-related, but it
      does have to be something you’re excited to share.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it’s a fascinating technology you want to spread awareness of, some rad way people are making art in CSS,
      success stories of members of underserved communities, or something awesome that you’re personally doing (we know
      you miss writing those Medium posts, right? ...right?), we all want to know so that we can share in this alumni
      community together and lift ourselves and each other higher than ever.
