        Hello Operation Spark Alumni,
      </p>
      <p>
        As we all know, the COVID-19 global pandemic, accompanied by mandatory social distancing, has caused a number of difficult situations for individuals and their families. Locally, we already know of a number of alumni looking for new opportunities resulting from mass layoffs in this time of economic uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        We, the Operation Spark Alumni Board, want to help. What better reason to have an alumni network than to lift each other up when times are tough?

        How we can help
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here are support options we are offering immediately:
      </p>
      <div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keeping your skills sharp is crucial as we grow as developers and search for new jobs. We will be <b>sharing resources</b> such as tutorials, YouTube channels, podcasts, books, news sites, and more to keep you learning and busy.
            </li>
            <li>
              First of those resources, we are proud to open the <a href="https://github.com/OperationSparkAlumni/alumni-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Operation Spark Alumni Network website repository</a> to all alumni. As discussed at the alumni mixer early this year, this website will be a way to connect with other alumni. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Alumni board members would like to begin holding talks/workshops on tech industry related topics. These will range from tools like <b>CSS/animations</b>, <b>React w/ GraphQL</b>, and <b>XPATH</b> to career advice like <b>knowing your worth/negotiation</b> and <b>developing your personal narrative</b>. We want to talk about things YOU are interested in, so please give us input on what you’d like to learn. We also welcome those interested in giving a talk themselves.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Operation Spark Slack workspace has a new <b>#career-advice</b> channel where alumni board members, as well as others, are ready and waiting to review resumes, cover letters, or field other questions you may have about the process of finding a new job.
            </li>
            <li>
              As often as we can, we will provide links to companies hiring, open positions, or job aggregator resources like <a href="https://www.stillhiring.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stillhiring.io.</a>
            </li>

        <p>Times are rough now, but we can get through it together. If you’ve lost your job it’s important you start your search ASAP, and keep your application pipeline strong. We want to help with what we can, so don't be silent; ask for help.</p>
        <p>Let us know in the #alumni channel on Slack, or via the link at the bottom of this page, what you need from us or the community.</p>
